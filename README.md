## Initializing Git and Adding Remote Origin

1.**Initialize Git**: Navigate to the directory where you want to initialize Git using the command line or terminal. Then, use the following commands:
 
 git init
 
 This command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory

2.**Add Remote Origin**: After initializing Git, you can add a remote origin to the
  repository. Replace '<remote_url>' with the URL of the remote repository you want to add. Use the folling command:
  
  git remote add origin <remote_url>

  This command sets up a new connection to the remote repository.

  After executing these commands, your local git repository will be initialized and connected to the remote origin
